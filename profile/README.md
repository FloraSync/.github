#  Welcome to the FloraSync base camp

What is FloraSync?

FloraSync is a project to provide free software to DIY farmers.  Our goal is to have software in the most arid places on Earth, savouring water to the last drop.  While the inital goal is water conservation in farming, we can apply this to any other activity that requires our most precious resource.  I'm open to ideas and projects.  The intial target is to have a web-app and community in which users can connect a device with an API key and receive a limited amount of free monitoring and interaction.  I say limited because this is self-funded and the goal will be to attract investment to make this a thriving non-profit.
